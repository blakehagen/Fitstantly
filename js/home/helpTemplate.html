				<h3>Incorrect "All-Time Steps Record" Data
				<p align="left"> Some users have reported their "All-Time Steps Record" data is not correct. This is a Fitbit issue. Fitstantly is pulling the correct data from the Fitbit API, but the data from Fitbit may not be correct. Verify in your Fitbit profile page under "My Achievements" ---> "Best" and see what Fitbit shows as your 1-day steps record. If your data is not correct, contact Fitbit support and they will resolve the issue.</h3>
